# Login angular app

This project was generated with angular CLI and it has ReactiveFormsModule for validation the login page and google font for nice text style.
This project has basically three page Login,Error and Home page.
when the application serve by uing `ng serve` it starts with login page and once we provide valide email mocked in user-mocks.ts file we will be redirect to success HomePage
else redirect to ErrorPage instructed to use valid email from mocked data.

## Run in local

Run `npm install` then `ng serve` to start the application. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to open the application. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further help
Below the reference image the application looks like running in locally:
